User story:
As a user, I can navigate through a character list and click a character to display information on the character. I can create a squad to 'save the universe' by entering my squad name and selecting enter. I can add characters to my squad by selecting "add to squad" once my character has been selected. I can remove the character by selecting the delete (X) button below each character in the build your squad box.
